For the rtron workshop on generating 3D Streetspace Models in CityGML 3.0 from OpenDRIVE data, the following software and data are required and should be installed prior to the workshop:

- Windows OS

- Docker Installation (i.e. Docker Desktop https://www.docker.com/get-started). <br/>For testing whether the Docker installation runs correctly you can use this Docker test image here: https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world

- Data and scripts that can be downloaded from here: https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiCYHWPtetehc1TybqWRpeRy/sample-datasets.zip

- FME for visualisation of the data (https://www.safe.com/)

- Optionally the 3D City Database (www.3dcitydb.org)
